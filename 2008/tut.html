<b>Basically what you're doing:</b><br>
Activating a glitch in Twilight Princess which forces the game to boot a file off the SD card which will install a channel that will let you do cool things, like play DVDs or run cheat codes and emulators. In order to activate the glitch, you will need a special modified save file. For more, search "Twilight Hack" on Wikipedia.<br><br>
The steps below are for <u>unmodified</u> Wii consoles. If you have a modded Wii console, it is assumed you know what you are doing and can install the patch youself from <a href=http://hackmii.com/><font color=white>HackMii</font></a><br><br>

 - Homebrew Browser (A program that lets you install other apps directly and smoothly<br>
 - Ocarina (A cheating program, similar to that of an Action Replay<br>
 - MPlayer (A movie player that you can watch DVDs and .MOV files on)<br>
