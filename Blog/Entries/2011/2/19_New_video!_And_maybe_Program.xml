    <richText>&lt;b&gt;I told you guys that I wasn&#x2019;t dead! And it&#x2019;s all new content too! Kind of...&#xD;&#xD;I mean, it isn&#x2019;t the promised Creepypasta BUT THAT IS PROBABLY BEING WORKED ON.&#xD;&#xD;Your Interactive Adventure can blaaaaaaaagh. Maybe I&#x2019;ll make a fourth generation IA LOLMFAO. No I won&#x2019;t.&#xD;&#xD;Anyway, I intend on doing more fourth generation videos. Then maybe even fifth gen if the process is similar enough.&#xD;&#xD;Also, I had a thought. A program similar to A-text that would edit the fourth generation text (or at the very least in heart gold and soul silver). VGText? Or simply V-text maybe? It&#x2019;s too bad I&#x2019;d have to make it for Windows... I&#x2019;m not very familiar with the process, although Visual Basic doesn&#x2019;t look that hard to pick up.&#xD;&#xD;We&#x2019;ll see bros!&#xD;&#xD;PS: I don&#x2019;t know if any of you saw, (you probably didn&#x2019;t), but I tried to make a Tumblr to see if my videos would catch on there with... no success. Oh well. This old standby is fine...&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
