    <richText>&lt;b&gt;As you may have, but probably didn&#x2019;t notice, there&#x2019;s a new tutorial entry under the tutorials page. It partially details how to insert your own custom Pok&#xE9;mon into the game. It&#x2019;s a work in progress, and is kind of a challenge to write, because I usually still even run into problems and have to discover my own workaround solutions to them. I guess that&#x2019;s just part of being a hacker though... maybe.&#xD;&#xD;Not much else is going on. I got a huge RAM upgrade for my computer (2GB to 8GB) so vmware and the like run at super full speed, which is nice. I guess.&#xD;&#xD;TTYL LOL.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
