GENERAL PROCESS FIRST TIMERS READ HERE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sixth gen is pretty different than the previous ones! So far, the development
depends entirely on running the modifications in an emulator. Another difference
from past gens is there's one all-in-one utility this time that works pretty well.

PK3DS
	- Primary ROM editor

PKHeX
	- Primary save editor

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE OTHER FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other files and folders that you see in this download are for modifying your
N3DS so that you are able to backup, run, and record the modifications that you make.

There's guides all over the internet, here are a few:

THAT'S ALL FOLKS

I will post a detailed description of ALL of the tools at a later date.

Help and detailed information for these tools will be available at a later date. Prety generic advice, but if you run into any trouble, go to http://www.google.com and type in the name of the program, and maybe like "pokemon hack" or the name of the game you're trying to edit.

Thanks, cheers, and happy hacking!
