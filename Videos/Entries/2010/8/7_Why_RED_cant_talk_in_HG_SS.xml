    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Now, I don&#x2019;t know about this one. It&#x2019;s something entirely different but also something that I&#x2019;ve been wanting to try for a while. Benv20 contacted me about doing some sort of collab, and he offered me his voice, which I so eagerly accepted. I hope the joke comes across. Also, I&#x2019;m so silly, for I removed the background music instead of lowering it. And another thing, I don&#x2019;t even think that the title makes sense! I mean, it might. Also, he isn&#x2019;t a Voice Actor if it&#x2019;s just himself. That&#x2019;s silly. Benv20 is the Voice Actor, RED is the character...&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
