Here's a list of all of the programs included, with a brief description of their function:
	A-Mart - Edit items’ names and prices for Poké-Marts
	A-Starter - Edit the starting Pokémon
	A-Tack - Edit the attacks of Pokémon (names, damage, effects, type)
	A-Text - A simple non-script based text editor
	AdvanceMap - Pretty much the best Map Editor for 3rd Gen.
	AnimEditor - Edit animations
	Easyscriptmaker - This is pretty straightforward, right?
	Elitemap - A package of useful tools, however most apply only to RSE: BaseEdit, Bewildered, Dexter, Elitemap, Fonted, Lips, Mapedit, Patted, Pet, PokCryGUI, PokePic, RKC, RSBall, Scripted, SnesEdit, Spread, TLP, unLZ
	Item Editor - Edit the items, 
	PokeTronic - I believe this is an alternative to YAPE
	TileMolester - Molest Tiles. Nah, I kid. This is more complicated than AdvanceMap
	XSE - Yet Another Script Editor. It’s all about preference (citation needed)
	YAPE - Yet Another Pokémon Editor. It’s also my favorite <3
	Visual Boy Linker - Gameboy emulator with link cable properties
