I am not responsible for any damage that may happen to your computer, your game, your DS or whatever may be damaged. You are free to use HyperGTS and also pass it to your friends. If you use my sourcecode it would be very nice if you mention this in your application or readme.

Have fun and
"catch 'em all!"
