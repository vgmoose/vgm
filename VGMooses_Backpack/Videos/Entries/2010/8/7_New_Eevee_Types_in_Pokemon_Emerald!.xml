    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This is another cool one! The idea is that science is wrong, or something. This one also has that sort of &#x201C;realistic&#x201D; tone to it. The sprites were hard to get in though... The Robo-Eevee one was more customly made, but the Ghost-Eevee was pretty much completely stolen from somebody through Google Images... OH WELL. This one should send shivers down your spine... and if it doesn&#x2019;t, well, too bad. ALSO THE IDEA FOR THE HACK WAS STOLEN FROM THE GIRL. Whatever &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;means. Also, please notice that the Robo-Eevee has no nature, and that the ghost Eevee has the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;same &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;nature as the one that &#x201C;died.&#x201D;&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
