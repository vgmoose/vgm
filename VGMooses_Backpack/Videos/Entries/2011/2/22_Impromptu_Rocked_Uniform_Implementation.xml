    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Wow, those are a lot of big words. Anyway, this is just a jerry-rigged version of an option to take on and off the Rocket uniform controlled by the player.&#xD;&#xD;When I was playing through this games, i wondered why this wasn&#x2019;t an option and the idea for this immediately came to me.&#xD;&#xD;I&#x2019;d like to see it on some item, as I don&#x2019;t know about the side-effects it has with the story, so we&#x2019;ll see.&#xD;&#xD;Patch coming soon, regardless of the side-effects, most likely.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
