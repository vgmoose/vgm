Programming & offsets: The_Fake_God

[Instructions]

-Load your rom (Gold/Silver)
-Select the sprite you want to edit from the dropdown list
-Press "Load" and edit.

[Buttons]
Everything enclosed in parentheses is the button´s name.

[<< & >>]
Every sprite has 6 images, go back and forth with these controls

[Load]
It will load the selected sprite.

[Save]
It will save ONLY the image you are editing, not the whole sprite!

[Gridlines]
Show/Hide the gridlines, they´re useful to know where to place your 
images.

[0x######]
It will show the address of the sprite you're viewing.

[Pallette controls]
The pallette thing is based on Snowbro's Tile Layer (which I used to find
out the addresses and test my gbc bbp editor, thanks!). It will let you 
change the pallette of the image in the editor. However that doesn´t mean 
you'll see the same colors in the game. Remember to use only three colors
and a mask. The mask is often the first color.
