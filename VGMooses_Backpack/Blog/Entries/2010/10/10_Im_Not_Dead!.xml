    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This is literally just an update to let you know that I&#x2019;m still alive! AND YES, THIS IS STILL GOING TO GET DONE &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;EVEN IF IT KILLS ME. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;I have a chunk of time to work on it on Tuesday, so I think I shall do that then. With any luck, it&#x2019;ll be finished.&#xD;&#x2028;Sorry this time. It&#x2019;s really just laziness now that I&#x2019;ve overcome that trainer-in-battle issue. I also installed Windows 7 as a virtual machine as opposed to Windows XP, and I&#x2019;d like to do another tutorial soon. Maybe even one detailing how to use the GTS to hack Pok&#xE9;mon in the current games.&#xD;&#xD;So yeah, that&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve got. Again, not that it matters, because nobody reads this. But whatever.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
