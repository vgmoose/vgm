    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Well, this is pretty cool right? iWeb is actually good for something! With... any luck... at all there will be lots of things here, such as Pok&#xE9;mon Hack downloads, or maybe, in the distant and slash or not so distant future tutorials. First things first though&#x2013; Pok&#xE9;mon Interactive Adventure. It is happening. Honest. It will take a while, but I have already privately uploaded (as some of you have so keenly noticed) the next pieces of the adventure. Unfortunately, unlike the earlier break in work, these ends don&#x2019;t tie up nicely at one single endpoint. So for now, I will continue uploading privately until the next time they all meet together. (Which according to the &#x201C;script&#x201D; is also at the end...) SORRY IT&#x2019;LL BE DONE SOON THOUGH MAYBE.&#xD;&#xD;What else? That&#x2019;s really all I&#x2019;ve got for ya&#x2019;ll (assuming at least more than one person is reading this...) I&#x2019;m off to go play &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deadspace: Extraction&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; for the first time now, and I hope I don&#x2019;t cry.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
