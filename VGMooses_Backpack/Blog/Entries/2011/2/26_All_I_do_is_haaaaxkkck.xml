    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Pok&#xE9;mon Black and white are coming out soon and I did a hacxkkie amajig for them.&#xD;&#xD;I also put up a preliminary fifth gen download link. I included a lot of tools from the fourth gen download that I was familiar with in addition to pptxt, for text editing. &#xD;&#xD;Also, you all probably have not noticed, but I updated the fourth gen download so that it&#x2019;s actually useful. It has everything you need in addition to detailed help files. All it&#x2019;s really missing is a map editor, which doesn&#x2019;t actually exist at this time so I&#x2019;m feeling pretty good about that...&#xD;&#xD;Yeeeeeahhhh...&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
