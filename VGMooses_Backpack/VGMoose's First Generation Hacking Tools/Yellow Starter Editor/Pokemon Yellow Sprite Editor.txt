Pokemon Yellow Sprite Editor
by: The_Fake_God

<Introduction>

This is one of my favorite programs. I´m not a pokemon fan at all, 
(maybe that´s why you´ll find a lot of ????? list items :P) but I
wanted to create a program capable of editing 2BP graphics with a
simple and clean interface. Happy editing.

<Pokemon Yellow Sprite Editor>

Supported:

*More than 40 editable sprites
*Visual Sprite Testing

Unsupported:

*A few scrambled tiles
*Command line

[Load Rom]
Select you *.gb or *.gbc rom image. If your rom has any other extension
then CHANGE IT! I forgot to add the "All files (*.*)" thingy. It won´t
check if you´re loading the correct file, so you can edit your .doc
science project with no problem (well, if it's 1MB size...). Oh well...

[Save Changes]
Just like it sounds. It will save ONLY the current sprite (the whole
picture inside the Sprite Viewer)

[Quit]
Exit the program

[Test Sprite]
This option is so cool! You can test the movement of your sprite just
by clicking on this menu option (or the button labeled "Test Sprite").

[Gridlines color]
Change the color of the grid (Sprite Editor).

[Sprite Pointer Color]
Have you seen that little red box that points to a sprite piece???

[Help]
This file

[About]
The program's about box.

[Sprite Viewer]
You just click on the piece of the sprite you want to edit and it will
be loaded into the Sprite Editor. Edit and the save.

[Sprite Editor]
Load the sprite, select a color from the pallette and paint.

[Pallette]
This pallette is NOT! the sprite's pallette. I added this option for the
sake of viewing your sprites with different colors (like TLP).

[Sprite]
Select a sprite to load. After you selected it from the list, click on
Load Sprite to view it.

[Gridlines]
Enable/Disable the gridlines.
