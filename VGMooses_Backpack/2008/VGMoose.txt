I was VERY upset when I logged in and saw my beatiful magikarp background GONE this morning. But I think I've found the problem!

I looked at the Page's source by right clicking and going to 'view source'

Since my Image is hosted on photobucket, I did a search for photobucket. And I found the part where they set the background image. It was set to this:

background-image: url(http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y162/AGS1/Magikarp-1.gif&time=1218129522771);

Now, it included a completely random stamp at the end called &time= and then a number(most likely the number of seconds from December 31st 1969, or something).

I checked the page souce again and got this:
background-image: url(http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y162/AGS1/Magikarp-1.gif&time=1218129668844);

Now, the stamp is different this time. Meaning youtube felt the need to add the current time onto the end of the image, therefore causing it to load improperly.

Unfortunately, there isn't anything that can be done about this right now.

Looking at the page source when logged out, the background image does function properly:
background-image: url(http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y162/AGS1/Magikarp-1.gif);

So, luckily, when another viewer looks at your channel, the &time= stamp is removed, so your channel will only be screwed up when you look at it, others will still see your background.

I don't know what caused this, but it's up to YouTube staff to fix the issue.

And there's my two cents!

(also, YouTube wouldn't let me post all this as a bulletin... must've been because I said '&time=' a lot, or something...)


EDIT: It seems like the problem has since been fixed... GOOD
