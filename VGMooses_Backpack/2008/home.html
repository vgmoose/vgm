Thursday, June 18, 2009</b>: <u> RETURN OF VGMOOSE?</u><br>
As you may or may not be aware, my entire YouTube account was spawned of summer boredom. Our school gets out June 25th, so in the following week should be regular resumption of YouTube videos. I don't think anyone actually checks this site though, so it's ok. The new way to communicate is via Twitter anyway. Follow me @VGMoose to stay up to date. Yeah.. That's it really.

<br><br><b>Monday, August 18, 2008 - 20:19</b>: <u>School, School, School</u><br>
The undeniable real world is coming for me. Believe it or not, I have a life, and it starts up again around September 3rd. Expect to see way less, if any, of me. But yeah, I hacked my Wii, and I'd really like to show you a video of it, but my recording materials are MIA. Maybe there will be a video. But there's that inevitable summer homework that needs to get done. -_-<br>
<b>EDIT - 20:33</b>: Expect a small Wii section once I get around to making the image

<br><br><b>Wednesday, August 13, 2008 - 22:18</b>: <u>Wow...</u><br>
Who would've guessed I would pull this <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpiVydlSrN0 target=newstuffs><font color=white>card?</font></a><br>
<b>EDIT - 22:19</b>: You can grab the character patch for emerald version <a href=CRAZY.ips><font color=white>here.</font></a> (right click and choose save target as)

<br><br><b>Monday, August 11, 2008 - 21:06</b>: <u>Wii Homebrew and Poll</u><br>
Well, I got back into the wonderful world of Wii homebrew! This time taking the standard way of the Homebrew Channel, I've been able to apply many mods to many games. S'too much fun! I'd love to show you guys, but I have that 100th hack, and well, if I upload another video I'll hit 100... On the other hand, the hack isn't done yet (or near completion for that matter). What should I do!? Email me... as if any of you actually WILL. U_U<br>
<b>EDIT - 22:48</b>: I may have been playing around too much with this homebrew stuff... <a href="0106800000b.jpg"><font color=white>I now find myself at the top of the Time Trials worldwide records in Mario Kart Wii</a>... I wonder how long it will take them to correct that...

<br><br><b>Sunday, August 10, 2008 - 5:02</b>: <u>100th hack MILESTONE</u><br>
Yes, that's right. I've hit my first obstacle in the 100th hack! It has to do with the way events were handled with my <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ydt8wVG4As><font color=white>Multiplayer technique</font></a>. I'm not sure WHY it didn't work, as I clearly got the Mew in that vid to function properly. It might have to do with the way I'm loading it, as I'm doing it differently since I'm too lazy to search for AR codes to activate the glitch normally.... blah. It shouldn't be that big of a deal. It's not like I was making that much progess with it ANYWAY. &gt;.&gt;
<br><b>EDIT - 5:07</b>: It looks like I've updated enough to reveal the super secret scrollbar!... looks kinda ugly... I'll make it look cooler later.
<br><b>EDIT - 5:14</b>: There, it blends now! It's another thing on the list of IE browser only things, though.


<br><br><b>Friday, August 08, 2008 - 12:43</b>: <u>New sections and some other stuff</u><br>
I decided to just add a new section, 'GlovePIE', which will include many of my glovepie scripts and possibly other wii-hombrew related content. I'm also trying out this time stamp thing on these updates... Hope it works...

<br><br><b>Friday, August 08, 2008</b>: <u>Gone Camping and Wiiiii</u><br>
Yup, I'm going camping this weekend, Friday-Monday. In other news, I finally was able to modify my Miis after MUCH <a href=http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y162/AGS1/Frustration-1.png target=top><font color=white>Frustration</font></a>. I've been thinking about new features to the site too, such as a Gallery/Archive for all my random pics and documents. And 100th hack is STILL needing to be worked on. I know I'm bad about coming through with promises, but I've already started and got a great script for this one, now I just need some MOTIVATION!!<br>
<b>EDIT:</b> Another random document. This time it's a script for GlovePie; a game called ShakeIt!. You can download it by right clicking <a href=ShakeIt!.PIE><font color=white>this</font></a> and clicking 'Save Target as'.

<br><br><b>Thursday, August 07, 2008</b>: <u>Edited 'Tools' Section and other Stuff</u><br>
I mean, I made the '100th' section look so smexy, I just had to fix this one. It's not better than the '100th' section, but there's no white space! By golly, how fancy!! Also, my laptop's charger just MELTED. I have to steal my Mom's whenever I want to use my computer. This puts a rather large hold on the 100th vids progress .__. Don't be expecting the awesome until like, late August.<br>
<b>EDIT:</b> I have written a documentation on what I think of the current <a href=vgmoose.txt><font color=white>YouTube Background issue</font></a>. It doesn't appear to be anything too serious, but nonetheless it's pretty annoying. T_T

<br><br><b>Wednesday, August 06, 2008</b>: <u>Added 'Contact' Section</u><br>
So now you can all annoy me personally. But really, send me an email and I'll respond pretty quickly. My iPhone automatically lets me know when I get one.

<br><br><b>Tuesday, August 05, 2008</b>: <u>Progress made in 100th vid!!</u><br>
Yes, that's right, slowly but surely it's getting there... we've moved up a whole percent! Keep in mind that this is relevant to the script, and I added a lot of things in this time, so that one percent is er, good quality? I guess that's what I'm trying to say...
