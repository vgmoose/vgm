Hey guys, VG here

Just as a quick shortcut for your busy little brains, the HGSS sprite database is located at a/0/0/4. After extracting it, add a .narc to the end, and edit it as your normally would. Once done, save and rename it back to 4 from .narc. Then compile your rom with ndstool.

The source code for this open source app is also included.
